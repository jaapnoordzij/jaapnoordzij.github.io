    <p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/192825/blog-img/20160204%20silence.jpg">It seems that in 2016 Martin Scorcese's film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0490215/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Silence</a> will finally be screened. Good reason to read the book, since it has been on my "To Read List" for a long time.</p>
<p>Being a Christian myself the book is quite unsettling but for other reasons than I thought. In 1644 two Jesuit priests from Portugal, father <em>Francisco Garrpe</em> and father <em>Sebastian Rodrigues</em>, travel from Macao to Japan. Their voyage is illegal since the Christian faith is banned in Japan under the Shogunate of <em>Tukogawa</em>. Although they have been warned not to go they decide to make the trip because the want to find out what happened to the famous father Ferreira. Rumour has it that the priest has renounced his faith under torture but since both know him very well from seminary, they cannot believe this. </p>
<p>After they arrive they meet some Christian farmers who hide and protect them at extreme cost for their own safety. Soon after that, the fathers decide to split up and pursue the search in their own way. Rodrigues is captured and put to trial at the court of the infamous "Inoue".</p>
<p>There are horrible scenes in the book about anguish, suppression and torture. What's most impressing though is the theological deliberations in the mind of Rodrigues:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Why is God Silent when is children are mistreated, tortured and die? Why does he not help out en deliver them from their tribulations? Before and upon arrival Rodrigues is sure that God is on his side and that he will be safe (even when he will be caught and be tortured to death) but gradually he starts to doubt his faith and find less and less security in his own convictions. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is Jesus not considerate with Judas? Why does he not help Judas and protect hem from his own self-destruction? All during the story (the book is written as a series of letters from Rodrigues to his superiors) Redrigues sees himself as the image of Christ. He is sure he will be captured, that he will be mistreated and tortured and that he will die on his own <em>Calvary</em> giving praise to God.  But as his doubt increases he starts to worrying whether he does not resemble Judas more than he wants to be true. Is he the Savior or the Traitor ? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And what is the role of this fellow <em>Kichijiro</em>. Rodrigues and Garrpe meet him in Macao and Kichijiro guides them to Japan and brings them into contact with the local Christians. He seems to be a Christian who has renounced his faith after torture and more and more develops into a lost soul, looking for absolution. Rodrigues more or less rightfully considers him as a "Judas" but why does the fellow then turn on these strong emotions in him, why cannot he give him absolution he is seeking? Why cannot Rodrigues treat Kichijiro the same way he wants Christ to treat Judas ?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is the psychological setting that makes the story really great. One of the most impressing moments is at the end of the book when Rodrigues is confronted with his interrogators and when they politely ask him to trample the cross with the image of Christ lying in the dirt. "Just a formality" they try to persuade him. It is the only moment in the book when God is not silent: The face of Christ on the cross speaks to him and says "Trample me", and Rodrigues breaks. </p>
<p>Great book and I am very interested to see what Marting Scorcese's film will look like.</p>
