    <p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/192825/blog-img/20160208%20buried-giant.jpg"> I actually wanted to buy Ishiguro's 'Never Let me go', his 2005 shortlisted Man Booker Prize Science Fiction novel but I could not find it in my local bookshop in Kathmandu and so I ended up with his latest book 'The Buried Giant'. Ishigoro did not publish a single book between 2005 and 2015 but then, he has never been a fast writer pumping out books a high speed. </p>
<p>The novel is a set in Old England, just after the time of King Arthur. But you could also describe it as a Fantasy novel. In fact the difference is not so big since most popular Fantasy (Lord of the Rings, The Wheel of Time, Game of Thrones) is described in a similar pre-Mediaval setting of Swords and Evil creatures. Given this context, Kazuo Ishiguro puts a lot more empathy in his book than Robert Jordan or George R.R. Martin does. The story is actually quite touching. </p>
<p>An old couple, Axl and Beatrice, are vaguely aware of the fact that they have lost their memories. They cannot even remember events from the recent past. Then one morning, after some vague recollections Axl and Beatrice decide they want to embark on a quest to find their lost son. They are not even sure they had a son but both seem to remember that the boy was lost after a quarrel or a war and that they will be able to find him in a village, a few days travel from where they live. </p>
<p>Once on the road they encounter several fellow travellers and each of them seems to have his own reasons to find out what is going on with the collective loss of memory. So the story develops in a real adventure. </p>
<p>Main theme in the book is the loss of memory. It can be seen as an effect of old age but it also covers truths that should better remain hidden. Ishiguro plays with his readers in a clever way. Most of the time during the book you have no idea where the road is leading to and as Axl and Beatrice travel through the country shards of the mist seem to lift revealing a truth that is even more horrible than they could think of. What is most impressive is the love of the old couple for each other. Each of them fears to know the details of their past and so they cling to the present and to their deep love for each other. </p>
<p>On a Social and Philosophical level the interesting question is the balance between peace-building and hatred. How do you handle a truth from the past that threatens to disrupt all you believe in and may plunge you and your society in civil war of racial hatred and revenge. Even in recent history we have seen many of these conflicts in Europe, the Middle East and Africa where atonement and looking forward seem too difficult for countries and individuals.</p>
<p>Ishiguro has written a great book that has too many implications to think about. I would love to talk more in depth about this in our book-club. </p>
